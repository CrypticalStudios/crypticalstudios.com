# Cryptical Website

This is a very simple static site with an optional Mailchimp signup form.

It is hosted on Netlify.

## Get started

`$ npm install`
`$ npm start`

It uses Netlify dev to run local versions of the functions with auto-reloading. You'll be able to browse the site at http://localhost:8888 and the functions at http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/function-name. This means you can make same-origin requests that will work locally and in staging / production using '/.netlify/functions/function-name'. See 'website/js/lambda-example.js' for a working demo.
